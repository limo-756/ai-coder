# AI Coder Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Function Mapping
- Create mapping of system functions and their details:
  - File operations (create, read, write, delete)
  - Directory operations (create, list, navigate)
  - Terminal command execution
  - Basic code generation capabilities

## Phase 2: Safety and Validation
- Implement permission system
- Add validation for all operations
- Create sandbox environment for testing
- Define scope limitations for commands

## Phase 3: LLM Integration
- Select base model (options: CodeLlama, StarCoder, etc.)
- Design prompt engineering for:
  - Code generation
  - Command understanding
  - System operation calls
- Implement function calling architecture
  - Define JSON schema for function calls
  - Create function registry
  - Build call handler system

## Phase 4: Training and Fine-tuning
- Create/collect training dataset
  - Code generation examples
  - Command execution patterns
  - System operation examples
- Implement fine-tuning pipeline
  - Try LoRA for efficient adaptation
  - Experiment with DPO for alignment
  - Test RLHF for improved performance

## Phase 5: Testing and Integration
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Build CI/CD pipeline
- Implement logging and monitoring
- Add error handling and recovery

## Phase 6: Extended Features
- Code review capabilities
- Git operations
- Package management
- Project scaffolding
- Multi-language support

## Phase 7: User Interface
- CLI interface
- API endpoints
- Integration with popular IDEs
- Documentation and examples

## Success Metrics
- Code generation accuracy
- Command execution success rate
- Response time
- Resource usage
- User satisfaction metrics
